                <h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>
                <div class="class">
                    <p>Create a list of the core terms that will be used in your thesis paper and write your own definitions in order to steer the discussion and avoid the use of different interpretations from multiple sources. For example: a philosopher may have coined the term ‘authenticity’ differently than an architect or anthropologist, hence it is crucial to define these terms even if referencing one previous definition. You may quote previous definitions for these terms and cite specific examples of how it relates to your work. This may be written or visualized.</p>

                <div class="class">
                    <p>Write an essay that frames your thesis within a larger historical and contextual framework including precedents in design and beyond.

Precedents need to be pointed out as particularly relevant to the thesis. This essay may be up to 10 pages long and can include illustrations. (We will discuss in class modes of writing — academic essay, personal essay, process, etc — to enhance your own writing skills and ensure your essay’s writing matches the tone of your thesis.</p>
